## What the project does
Our project aims to extract names of the publicly traded companies that frequently appear in the headlines of top business-oriented websites. Consequently, we will link them with available financial pieces of information (i.e., current stock price, dividend yield, etc.) from Yahoo. We will get the company names from RSS feeds.
## Why the project is useful
This tool may point out potential investment opportunities for investors based on the appearances of companies' names in relevant news. If we decide to develop the news-based approach to investments further, this will be one of the essential features in trading algorithms.
